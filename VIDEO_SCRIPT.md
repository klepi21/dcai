## **Part 2: Strategy Creation & AI Analysis (0:20 - 0:50)**

"Creating a strategy is simple. You select the **Token** you want to accumulate, set your **Buying Frequency**, define the **Amount** for each trade, and most importantly, lock in your **Take Profit** percentage."

"But before you commit, **HODLOTH**, our AI analyst, reviews your plan. It analyzes the metrics and offers an optimized strategy. The choice is yours: you can **apply the AI's optimization** for potentially better results, or **ignore it** and stick to your original plan."

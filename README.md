**DCAi** is a next-generation decentralized application (dApp) built on the **MultiversX** blockchain. It revolutionizes traditional Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) by integrating AI-driven execution logic. Instead of buying at arbitrary time intervals, DCAi analyzes market volatility and liquidity to execute swaps at optimal moments, maximizing your entry efficiency while automating your exit strategy.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 AI-Driven Execution
Unlike standard DCAs that buy blindly, our **Neuro-Engine** monitors on-chain metrics 24/7. It executes your scheduled buys during favorable market conditions to optimize your average entry price.

### 🛡️ Non-Custodial Security
You stay in control. Funds are deposited into smart contracts where **only you** have the authority to manage or withdraw them. There are no middlemen, just code.

### 💰 Automated Take-Profit
Set your target and let the bot do the rest. Configure a profit percentage (e.g., +20%, +50%), and the smart contract will automatically sell your accumulated bag back to USDC when the target is hit.

### ⚡ MultiversX Speed & Low Fees
Built on one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains, ensuring your transactions are lightning-fast and cost mere fractions of a cent.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Connect Wallet**: Login securely with xPortal, Ledger, or Web Wallet.
2.  **Select Strategy**: Choose your target token (e.g., EGLD, MEX, HTM).
3.  **Configure**: Set your investment amount, frequency (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), and Take-Profit target.
4.  **Deposit**: Sign the transaction to fund your strategy with USDC.
5.  **Relax**: The AI monitor takes over, executing trades and managing your position automatically.
